# 📚 HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT - Supervised Learning

Hi everyone! 👋
Based on today's session, it's time to put your learning into practice!

## 🎯 Your Task:

Work with the `loan_data.csv` dataset I'm sharing below. Your job is to:

1. _First, identify what type of problem this is_ - Classification or Regression? 🤔
2. _Analyze the dataset_ - explore the features and understand what you're predicting
3. _Follow the same steps we practiced today:_
   • Data preprocessing
   • Train-test split  
   • Train multiple models
   • Evaluate and compare models
   • Make predictions on new data

## 📋 What to Prepare:

1. Your complete code (Jupyter notebook or Python script)
2. Model comparison results
3. Your best model's accuracy
4. A brief explanation of which model performed best and why

## ⏰ Deadline:

Come prepared to next session with your solution

Remember to apply everything we learned today. If you get stuck, feel free to ask questions!
Good luck! 🚀
