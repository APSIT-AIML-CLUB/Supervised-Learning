# Supervised Learning

## Introduction
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs based on the provided examples.

## Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms
1. **Linear Regression**
   - Used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.
2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Used for binary classification problems where the target variable has two possible outcomes.
3. **Decision Trees**
   - A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks.
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Used for classification tasks by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.
6. **Neural Networks**
   - Complex models inspired by the human brain, used for a variety of tasks including image and speech recognition.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Python: `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`
2. **Load Your Data**
   - Use `pandas` to load and preprocess your dataset.
3. **Choose an Algorithm**
   - Select an appropriate algorithm based on your problem type (regression or classification).
4. **Train Your Model**
   - Split your data into training and testing sets and train your model using the training set.
5. **Evaluate Your Model**
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate your model's performance.
