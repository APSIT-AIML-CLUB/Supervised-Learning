# Supervised Learning Session ðŸ“˜

This repository contains materials from a supervised learning session conducted for club learners.  
It covers both **regression** and **classification** techniques with hands-on practice, datasets, and reference slides.



## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **`assignment/`**  
  Contains a supervised learning dataset.  
  ðŸ‘‰ Learners are expected to apply the concepts covered in the session on this dataset.

- **`practice/`**  
  Contains two Jupyter notebooks with `FIXME` placeholders that were corrected live during the session:

  - `Regression_FIXME.ipynb` â†’ Linear Regression
  - `Classification_FIXME.ipynb` â†’ Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM

- **`solution/`**  
  Final corrected versions of the practice notebooks:

  - `Regression.ipynb`
  - `Classification.ipynb`

- **`datasets/`**  
  Datasets used in practice notebooks:

  - `50_Startups.csv` â†’ Regression
  - `breast_cancer.csv` â†’ Classification

- **`slides/`**  
  A PDF slide deck covering:
  - Basic ML terminology
  - Flow of a Machine Learning pipeline
  - Regression in supervised learning
